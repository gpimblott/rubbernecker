Pivotal is useful. But it has a weird and complex layout so it is hard to use for day to day stuff. Rubbernecker simplifies it in a Kanban-esque fashion.

It organises things by status, displays simple information about each story, who is working on it, and how long it has been in that state.

**UPDATES for this fork**
Pivotal also doesn't handle multiple teams at all. This fork has been designed to handle each team as a project
All searches are across multiple projects and transparently aggregated
It also focussed on providing stats across projects to make it easier to generate reports

Includes : Kanban boards oer team, Roadmap display, Story and Epic searching

##Installation

Clone this repo

``` 
npm install
```

##Â Running
After completing above installation instructions, to run locally without Basic Authentication:

``` 
DEBUG=rubbernecker:* PIVOTAL_API_KEY=your-api-key PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id npm start
```

If you want to try out the stunning Basic Auth (useful for when you don't want everyone getting straight to your story overviews)
``` 
DEBUG=rubbernecker:* PIVOTAL_API_KEY=your-api-key PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id USE_AUTH=true USERNAME=username PASSWORD=password npm start
```
